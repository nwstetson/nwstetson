### Welcome! 🐒🐷🐕
My name is Noah Stetson, and I am a 4th-year undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin. I am currently pursuing a B.A. in psychology, and a minor in primatology. I am very passionate about science communication, animal behavior, and also my primate meme account ([@primate.memes](https://www.instagram.com/primate.memes/) on Instagram), which I update regularly to help teach people more about primates!

You can email me at [stetson@utexas.edu](mailto:kstetson@utexas.edu)
